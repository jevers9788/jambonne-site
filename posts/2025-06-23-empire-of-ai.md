# Empire of AI Review

DATE: 2025-06-23


Karen Hao has released a non-too-flattering expose of the macchinations happening behind the scenes of our favorite chatbot, ChatGPT.

The action opens with the no-good-very-failed attempt to oust Sam Altman from OpenAI. 

Books like this make me want to jump in front of a bus or lie down and stare at the ceiling for the rest of my life.


Questions:
- Does the imperialism parallel really work?
- Tech person language creep

- Altman is maybe the first 'avoidant man' CEO of this caliber. Admittedly, I don't have a good sense of the average CEO psycholical profile, but I don't imagine that being 'too agreeable' is a problem that many of them face.

- How much does this upset me? How hopeless does it make me feel? It reinforces the pessimistic attitude I hold towards not just big tech companies, but companies in general. This corroborates a Marxist critique of entrepeneurial adventuring; it may begin with good intentions, as growth swells, as interest intensifies, the people at the helm of these ventures may genuinely believe in their project with such purity that costs incurred along the way are tolerable. The end of this trajectory is usually collapse or a rule by force, where the idealism that animated its beginnings is so threadbare that nobody thinks of it as anything except some kind of evil toll that must be paid and can't be routed around, and there's a huge pile of bodies piled up behind it from its struggle to achieve dominance. Is this where OpenAI is headed or is it already there?
  Hao does excellent reporting, travelling to countries where the costs of training and serving OpenAI's models are not at all hidden.
