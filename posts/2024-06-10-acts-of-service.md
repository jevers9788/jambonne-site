Most of the story's development is contained in the relationship of Eve, Olivia, and Nathan. As other reviewers
and Fishman have noted, this portion of the novel is chiefly concerned with how Eve and Olivia relate to each
other, with Nathan as a sort of stabilizing medium. Eve enjoys being watched, Olivia watching. 

But halfway, maybe two-thirds, of the way through, there's a shift of focus. Olivia first recedes, and Eve's relationship
with Nathan occupies more of the story. Nathan becomes slightly, but not substantially, more of a person for Eve, and
for the reader. Becoming more real, he becomes more vulnerable; a development that is made concrete when he asks
Eve to provide a deposition in the <what was her name> case.

The opening of the legal case marks the final third of the novel. After Olivia, Nathan leaves the narrative focus, and
Eve is alone and standing before the law. This part is the culmination of her experiences garnered
in the earlier parts of the novel. During the court scene, the ethical questions that have bubbled up for Eve
when she's consulted with Fatima, Olivia -- and herself -- are expressed by the prosecuting attorney. There is
plenty to suggest that the prosecutor serves as a representative of a liberal, content-based framework of feminism.
Her line of questioning reveals a suspicion that Eve and Olivia have been manipulated by a man with more power than they.
The scene ends with the prosecutor asking Eve for her definition of feminism. Eve answers with <whatever that quote is>.

Does it make any sense to answer the question this way? Saying that feminism is 'the recognition of difference'
is a satisfactory response, allowing for a certain prioritization of abstraction in political questions. The notion of
difference works just as well with any number of other frameworks, idealogical, ontological, theological (could keep going).
Ultimately, this falls short of serving as a justification for what Eve is being charged with, or the prosecutor
seems to think so, but Fishman doesn't. If Eve fails to put together a coherent, reasoned justification for why
Nathan shouldn't be locked away with the rest of the sexual predators, it doesn't keep us from a happy ending.
The novel finishes with Eve and Olivia coming together as friends. This is in keeping with a refrain built throughout
the story; how desire operates outside of the bounds of reason, and certain things are best left to intuition,
instinct, and, another word figuring prominently, grace.
