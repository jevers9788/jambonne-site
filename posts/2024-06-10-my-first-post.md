# Acts of Service Review


What happens? 

Narrator, Eve, posts nudes on a forum. Olivia responds on behalf
of her boyfriend, Nathan. They sleep together. Olivia likes to watch,
Eve likes to be watched. Eve is taken by surprise when her boring wholesome
doctor girlfriend breaks up with her.

There's push and pull between Olivia and Eve as Eve tries to get to know Olivia better.
Eve's roommate Fatima has doubts about what Eve is up to.
Eventually (why?) Nathan comes to see Eve without Olivia.
Eve discovers that Nathan is married and feels relief (why?)

Nathan comes to Eve to ask if she will offer deposition. Orthodox feminist
thinks Eve is being taken advantage of, questions her definition of feminism.

Olivia and Eve meet in the end, without Nathan.

Themes:

- acts of service -- one of the 'love languages', whats good for the goose isn't always good for the gander
- the terrain of our lives -- eve's lots of rooms
- less about desire than being; she thinks that she's meant to be a sex objects, why?


Quotes:
- ethical direction leads to skepticism
- somehow inappropriate to be Mr. Darcy style moralist in contemporary life p. 210


q's:

- what kind of nudes forum? 
- whats up with the bowl?
