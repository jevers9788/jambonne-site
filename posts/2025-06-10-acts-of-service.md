Most of the story's development is contained in the relationship of Eve, Olivia, and Nathan. As other reviewers
and Fishman have noted, this portion of the novel is chiefly concerned with how Eve and Olivia relate to each
other, with Nathan as a sort of stabilizing medium. Eve enjoys being watched, Olivia watching. 

But halfway, maybe two-thirds, of the way through, there's a shift of focus. Olivia first recedes, and Eve's relationship
with Nathan occupies more of the story. Nathan becomes slightly, but not substantially, more of a person for Eve, and
for the reader. Becoming more real, he becomes more vulnerable; a development that is made concrete when he asks
Eve to provide a deposition in the <what was her name> case.

The opening of the legal case marks the final third of the novel. After Olivia, Nathan leaves the narrative focus, and
Eve is alone and standing before the law. This part is the culmination of her experiences garnered
in the earlier parts of the novel. During the court scene, the ethical questions that have bubbled up for Eve
when she's consulted with Fatima, Olivia -- and herself -- are expressed by the prosecuting attorney. There is
plenty to suggest that the prosecutor serves as a representative of a liberal, content-based framework of feminism.
Her line of questioning reveals a suspicion that Eve and Olivia have been manipulated by a man with more power than they.
The scene ends with the prosecutor asking Eve for her definition of feminism. Eve answers with <whatever that quote is>.

5. 

Does it make any sense to answer the question this way? Saying that feminism is 'the recognition of difference'
is a satisfactory response, allowing for a certain prioritization of abstraction in political questions. The notion of
difference works just as well with any number of other frameworks, idealogical, ontological, theological (could keep going).
Ultimately, this falls short of serving as a justification for what Eve is being charged with, or the prosecutor
seems to think so, but Fishman doesn't. If Eve fails to put together a coherent, reasoned justification for why
Nathan shouldn't be locked away with the rest of the sexual predators, it doesn't keep us from a happy ending.
The novel finishes with Eve and Olivia coming together as friends. This is in keeping with a refrain built throughout
the story; how desire operates outside of the bounds of reason, and certain things are best left to intuition,
instinct, and, another word figuring prominently, grace.






Quotes:
- ethical direction leads to skepticism
- somehow inappropriate to be Mr. Darcy style moralist in contemporary life p. 210


q's:

- what kind of nudes forum? 
- whats up with the bowl?
- why pay attention to this book?


***************************************************


	Lillian Fishman's debut novel, "Acts of Service" came out in the Spring of 2022, which means that my review comes years late. Why bother reviewing it?

	"Acts of Service" figures among a group of 'millenial writers' like Ottesa Moshfegh, Raven Leilani, Sally Rooney. 'Millenial literature' is a lazy way to group books, but 'autofiction' doesn't quite apply to all of this grouping, and we may need more time for the dust to settle before a more fitting appelation makes itself known.

      Nomenclature aside, this isn't a genre that I especially enjoy reading. Most of these books are dominated by a listlessness that mostly makes me sad, though this doesn't stop me from reading them.
      Reading "Acts of Service" did not spare me this feeling; there's something awful about someone drifting towards or into their thirties in Brooklyn. That "Acts of Service" is a lot randier than its millenial fiction peers wouldn't have been enough to offset that feeling. This doesn't appear to be true for other reviewers and blurb contributors, for whom the heat of the love triangle that makes up the bulk of the storyline provided enjoyment enough.
      Most reviewers focus on the love triangle, the contradictions presented to anyone with more carnal desires that don't match their politics and morals. This is all interesting enough in itself (and pretty sexy, depending on what you're into), but what I found most compelling about this novel, and what I think separates it from its peers, is how Fishman resolves the contradiction (here being 'what to do when you're a queer feminist but find yourself uncontrollably drawn to a man meeting the 666 criteria).

      Let's get a quick synopsis down so that anyone who doesn't mind spoilers can get their bearings:

      Eve is a listless woman approaching thirty in Brooklyn. Luckily for readers who might stop reading after learning this, we're only given this information after Eve uploads a bunch of nudes to a forum on the internet. We're never told what she studied or wants to do with her life, but we know it can't have been medicine or comp sci or something productive, because her dad sometimes calls her on the phone to ask harriedly when she is going to stop working at a coffee shop. Eve has a frustratingly virtuous doctor girlfriend. The novel opens with Eve hiding in this frustratingly virtuous girlfriend's bathroom and uploading a curated subset of her personal nude collection to somewhere on the internet. Olivia responds to one of the nudes, and they agree to meet. When Eve meets Olivia, Olivia reveals that she was acting as a messenger for her boyfriend, Nathan, who is actually the one pulling the strings. Eve is <I forget how she initially responds?>, but agrees to meet as a throuple. She is surprised to find that Nathan is possessed of deity-like magnetism. Very quickly, a love triangle blossoms <q: is this really a love triangle or is there some other word?>. They sleep together frequently, the relationship becomes a more intimate version of 'Eyes Wide Shut'. Eve likes to be watched, Olivia likes watching.
      After a few months of covert trysts, Romi surprises Eve by revealing that she has also been unfaithful and terminating the relationship. Eve is sad because <I also forget why? Because she thought of Romi as a blank and virtuous palette?>. But she continues the trysts, using her roommate Fatima as a sounding board. Fatima has doubts about the arrangement, and voices many of the concerns that the more morally upright reader might be having. Eve can't quite justify what she's doing, but is interested in, and enjoys, the menage a trois enough to go on with it. <why does she like it?>.
      By now, we're around two-thirds of the way through the novel. Some reviewers have described the trajectory of the story here as 'deteriorating', or 'sagging', but for me, this is where things begin to get interesting. First, after an awkward altercation at an Italian restaurant almost kitty-corner from this reviewer's apartment, Nathan and Eve begin to see one another without Olivia. The menage is slimmed to a deux, and we begin to learn more about Nathan, who has acted largely as a distant font of power and authority up until this point. <what does he do that humanizes him?>. The gradual revealing of who Nathan is aside from a magnetic finance bro with presumably excellent dick game culminates in the ultimate descent from Olympus: he reveals that he is in trouble and needs Eve to help him. She can help him by providing a deposition in a court case where another young woman, who Nathan has also been fucking, is suing him for <what?>.
      Now comes the final part of the novel. Nathan also recedes from focus, and Eve is alone, in a court room at the witness stand. Making the structure developed in the novel explicit; there is a volatile group of three, then just two, and at the moment where there Eve is alone, she has to answer for it all in front of a power-suit wearing female prosecutor who we're given to understand figures as liberal, institutional feminism. The prosecutor is ethical perspective manifest in the law. At the conclusion of the court scene, the prosecutor asks Eve for her definition of feminism. Eve offers this as a response: "".
     I picked this out as sort of the core of the novel's content, or the point where all of the nuanced opinions and uncertainty have to justify themselves before the power of the law, which, in the case of the common law derived variety of the American justice system, is largely based on precendence and norms.
     Fishman, as I read somewhere, is a big Henry James fan. And if there's one thing that critics agree on, its that the unifying thread in James' work is his concern with social relations as they appear in norms. Amidst the sloppiness of life lived, the ambiguous and often confusing experience of just talking to someone else, how can we depend on rules like 'dont cheat on your girlfriend', 'dont fuck anyone that you work with', 'dont be attracted to someone becaue they posses x,y, or z superficial characteristic'? How do we even know that these are rules? This, I gathered over the reading of 'Acts of Service' is part of what Fishman is digging into, sexy stuff aside. Norms play a steering role in how we go through life, they expand or hinder our freedom. How should we treat other people? What happens to people who are too trusting or reliant on unspoken norms?
     Which makes it worth asking, is Eve's answer here satisfactory? The prosecutor does not seem to think so. Ultimately, the reader might agree with the prosecutor. Saying that feminism is 'difference' isn't wrong, per se, but its too capacious an answer to actually mean anything -- the same answer could be given, with equal validity, to effectively any similar kind of question about basically any variety of political or ontological questions.
     Is it a problem that the answer isn't satisfactory? In the novel, I think not. The ending qualifies as a happy one. "Acts of Service" ends with Eve and Olivia together, this time without Nathan. We discover that, through the entanglements of the romantic trio, Olivia and Eve have, each in their own ways, achieved a kind of self-actualization through the medium of forbidden group sex. It's like in the end of an anime, one spring day, sunlight beaming down through cherry blossom trees, all of the characters unite, free of their hardships.
